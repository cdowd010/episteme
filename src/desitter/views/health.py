"""Health checks for the project.

Composes validation, render-staleness, and structure checks into a single
health report. Intended as the primary "is everything OK?" command for
both MCP tools and the CLI.

Returns a structured report rather than raw findings, so callers can
make automated pass/fail decisions.
