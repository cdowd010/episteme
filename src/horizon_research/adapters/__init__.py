"""Infrastructure adapters.

Implements the ports defined in epistemic/ports.py using stdlib I/O.
All adapters are thin — no business logic lives here.

Dependency rule: adapters depend on epistemic (for ports/types), never
on core/views/features. Those layers depend on adapters through the ports.

External library rule: stdlib only (json, pathlib, subprocess, hashlib).
No third-party imports at module level.
