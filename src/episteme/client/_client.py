    """Python client that owns persistence and exposes typed helpers.

    ``EpistemeClient`` is the top-level object a researcher interacts
    with. It is constructed via ``connect()`` rather than directly.

    The class is assembled from three mixin bases:
    - ``_EpistemeClientCore``: lifecycle (save, context manager) and
      generic gateway operations (register, get, list, set, transition,
      query).
    - ``_EpistemeClientResourceHelpers`` (via ``_EpistemeClientResourceHelpers``):
      typed keyword-argument helpers for all ten entity types, delegating
      to the generic operations above.

    Usage::

        import episteme as ds

        with ds.connect() as client:
            result = client.register_hypothesis(
                id="C-001",
                statement="...",

    """Build a ``EpistemeClient``, optionally backed by a repository.

    The typical researcher workflow is simply ``ds.connect()`` from a
    project workspace directory. The function loads the project config,
    derives paths, hydrates the graph, builds the gateway, and returns a
    ready-to-use client.

    Args:
        repo: Optional ``GraphRepository`` implementation to use for
            loading and saving. When provided, the graph is loaded from
            the repository before the client is returned. When ``None``,
            ``connect`` locates the repository automatically by searching
            for a ``episteme.toml`` in the current directory tree.
        graph: Optional pre-loaded ``EpistemicGraphPort`` instance. When
            provided, this graph is used directly and no repository load
            is performed. Useful for testing or in-memory workflows.
            Cannot be combined with ``repo``.

    Returns:
        EpistemeClient: A fully initialized client ready for use.
