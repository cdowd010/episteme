"""Managed-prose sync services.

Provides operations that keep human-readable prose blocks (e.g. generated
markdown sections) in sync with canonical epistemic state. These functions
depend on a ``ProseSync`` collaborator that owns the I/O and knows which
blocks exist.

Distinct from structural diagnostics (``check.py``): prose operations
carry a filesystem collaborator and have a write path (``sync_prose``).
