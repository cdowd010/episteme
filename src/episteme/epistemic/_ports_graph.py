    Any implementation that satisfies this protocol — an in-memory

    wherever an epistemic graph is required. The ``Gateway`` and all
    control-plane code depend on this protocol rather than the concrete
    ``EpistemicGraph`` class.

    Every mutation method returns a NEW graph instance. Callers must
    replace their reference with the return value. The old instance is
    never modified.
