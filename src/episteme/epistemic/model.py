    Hypotheses are the fundamental building blocks of the knowledge graph.
    They form a directed acyclic graph via ``depends_on``, where derived
    hypotheses reference the foundational hypotheses they rest upon.

    The EpistemicGraph maintains bidirectional links between hypotheses and
    their assumptions (``Assumption.used_in_hypotheses``) and analyses
    (``Analysis.hypotheses_covered``). These backlinks are updated
    automatically during registration and updates — callers should
    never modify them directly.

        id: Unique identifier for this hypothesis (e.g. ``"H-001"``).
        statement: The human-readable text of the assertion.

            ``DERIVED`` (depends on other hypotheses).

    Predictions are the empirical interface between the epistemic graph

    classification, and tracks lifecycle status as evidence accumulates.

    Key semantic distinctions:

    - ``hypothesis_ids``: The hypotheses that jointly imply this prediction (the
      logical derivation chain). Most non-trivial predictions require
      multiple hypotheses. No backlink exists on Hypothesis — the graph validates
      existence only.
    - ``tests_assumptions``: Assumptions this prediction was explicitly
      designed to test — its outcome bears on whether those assumptions
      hold. Bidirectional with ``Assumption.tested_by``.
    - ``conditional_on``: Assumptions this prediction is conditioned on —
      it is valid only if these assumptions hold. Unlike
      ``tests_assumptions``, these are taken as given. A prediction
      cannot both test and condition on the same assumption.
    - ``derivation``: Prose explaining *why* ``hypothesis_ids`` imply this
      prediction (the logical reasoning). Distinct from ``specification``
      (the formula or relationship being tested).

        evidence_kind: Temporal/methodological classification —
            ``NOVEL_PREDICTION``, ``RETRODICTION``, or ``FIT_CONSISTENCY``.
        measurement_regime: Evidence form — ``MEASURED``, ``BOUND_ONLY``,
